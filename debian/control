Description: Bindings to the Linux input handling subsystem
 *evdev*
 -------
 .
 This package provides bindings to the generic input event interface in
 Linux. The *evdev* interface serves the purpose of passing events
 generated in the kernel directly to userspace through character
 devices that are typically located in ``/dev/input/``.
 .
 This package also comes with bindings to *uinput*, the userspace input
 subsystem. *Uinput* allows userspace programs to create and handle
 input devices that can inject events directly into the input
 subsystem.
